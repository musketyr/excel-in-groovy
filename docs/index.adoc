= Excel in Groovy Workshop
Vladimír Oraný <https://github.com/musketyr[icon:github[] @musketyr]>

== Getting Started

This workshop will learn you how to use http://metadataconsulting.github.io/spreadsheet-builder/[Groovy Spreadsheet Builder] API
to write and read OfficeOpenXML Documents (XSLX). Some of the topics needed for finishing the exercises are written directly in this document
 but you can always follow http://metadataconsulting.github.io/spreadsheet-builder/[Groovy Spreadsheet Builder Documentation] for the ones not covered
 or for deeper insight.

=== Software Requirements

To get started you need to have installed following:

 * Java Development Kit 8
 * OfficeOpenXML Documents (XSLX) compatible application

IMPORTANT: Although you should be able to display the resulting XLSX file in any compatible application
the workshop exercises were so far only tested in Microsoft Excel.

Project is built using https://gradle.org/[Gradle] build tool but it's using https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html[Gradle Wrapper]
so you are not required to install it manually nor you don't have to be afraid of version clash.

You can use IDE of your choice but https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] provides so far the best
Gradle and Groovy integration even in the free Community version and it will be used in live coding sessions during
the workshop.

*To get started download link:archives/excel-in-groovy.zip[exercise project archive file] and unzip it*.


=== Business Model

In most of the exercises are using sample sales data from https://www.kaggle.com/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data.

Inside the exercises, the data are represented using following type structure to mock existing application.

<1> Business Model
<2> Test Utilities
<3> Test Data
<4> Implementation class
<5> Spock Specifications

Each exercise is represented as http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.0/index.html[Spock] specification.
Each of the specification tests one method in `ExcelIntegration` class. This is where you are going to write
your own code.

== Writing Spreadsheets

First 5 exercises will teach you how to write rich XLSX files.

=== 1. Sales Report

.Sales Report
****
Sale manager wants to see all the orders in spreadsheet so she can easily filter particular customers and products.
Export all the orders in a spreadsheet, add automatic filter and freeze the first row and column so it's easily navigable.
Make sure the texts displayed fit into the colums and numbers and dates are formatted properly.
****

Implement method `buildSalesReport` in `ExcelIntegration` class to make `_01_SalesReportSpec` passing.
See link:xlsx/test01.xlsx[existing file] for reference.

==== Builder Basics

Spreadsheet builder follows the logical nested structure of the spreadsheet where
there is several sheets in the workbook, each of the sheets having several rows and each of the rows
containing several cells. The row and column indicies are held internally so there is no need to address
rows and cells by their indicies unless you want to skip some rows or columns.

[source,groovy]
----
import eig.model.Order
import org.modelcatalogue.spreadsheet.builder.api.SpreadsheetBuilder
import org.modelcatalogue.spreadsheet.builder.api.SpreadsheetDefinition
import org.modelcatalogue.spreadsheet.builder.poi.PoiSpreadsheetBuilder

class ExcelIntegration {
    static SpreadsheetDefinition buildSalesReport(Map<Integer, Order> orders) {
        SpreadsheetBuilder builder = PoiSpreadsheetBuilder.INSTANCE         // <1>
        return builder.build {                                              // <2>
            sheet('Data') {                                                 // <3>
                filter auto                                                 // <4>
                freeze('A', 1)                                              // <5>
                row {                                                       // <6>
                    cell {                                                  // <7>
                        value 'Order Number'                                // <8>
                        width auto                                          // <9>
                    }
                    // ...
                }
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
    // ...
}
----

<1> Obtaining an instance of `SpreadsheetBuilder` based on Apache POI
<2> Building new spreadsheet and returning `SpreadsheetDefinition` which can be later written into file or stream.
<3> Creating new sheet called _Data_
<4> Enabling the automatic filter for all the data in the current sheet
<5> Freezing the first row and the column _A_
<6> Creating new row
<7> Creating new cell
<8> Assigning _Order Number_ string into the cell
<9> Letting the column to fit into the width of the longest text present in the column

==== Formatting Values

Format can be specified to any cell within the style definition.
See http://metadataconsulting.github.io/spreadsheet-builder/#_data_formats[the data formats section of the documentation] for more information on topic.

[source,groovy]
----
cell {
    value line.sales
    style {
        format '#.00'                                                       // <1>
    }
}
cell {
    value Date.from(order.date.toInstant(ZoneOffset.of('+1')))              // <2>
    style {
        format 'dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm'                                           // <3>
    }
}
----

<1> Fixing the number of digits of the sales to two digits after the decimal point
<2> Converting the Java 8 `LocalDateTime` to `Date`
<3> Printing the date in given format _day.month.year hour:minute_

=== 2. Executive Report

.Executive Report
****
Executive officer wants to review states of all orders. Export all the orders to the spreadsheet and highlight every
order which hasn't been shipped yet. For example orders with status _resolved_ should be highlighted with _light green_ color.
Don't repeat the values common to whole order but merge the cells instead.
Display the prices with two fixed digits after the decimal point and prefix them with `€` sign. Render the dates properly.
The headlines should be centered, bold and they should have been written using bigger font as rest of the data.

****

Implement method `buildExecutiveReport` in `ExcelIntegration` class to make `_02_ExecutiveReportSpec` passing.
See link:xlsx/test02.xlsx[existing file] for reference.

==== Merging Cells

You can define `colspan` and `rowspan` for every cell. Using `colspan` will also shift he next column pointer so
you will automatically continue after the merged cells. On the other hand `rowspan` will not change the inner next row
index so you will continue on the row bellow current one. This fits most of the use cases where the columns
are known and data are entered into rows dynamically.

[source,groovy]
----
row {                                                                       // <1>
    cell {
        value "Grouped"
        rowspan 5                                                           // <2>
        colspan 2                                                           // <3>
    }
    cell 'Next Cell'                                                        // <4>
}
row {                                                                       // <5>
    cell('C') {                                                             // <6>
        value 'Render this under the "Next Cell"'
    }
}
----

<1> Create new row `1`
<2> Set the `rowspan` of the cell - the cell will render through the rows `1` to `5`
<3> Set the `colspan` of the cell - the cell will render through the columns `A` and `B`
<4> Creates new cell - the cell will be automatically placed into column `C`
<5> Creates new row `2` - no rows are skipped
<6> Creates new cell in column `C` to not to collide with the merged cell `A1`

==== Named Styles

There is limited number of styles which can be declared within the spreadsheet. For files containing
only couple of cell this is not a problem but if you have thousands of rows you can reach the limits easily.
It is a good practise to use named styles instead. Named styles are defined in the top level of the builder
code and then can be applied to either whole row or a single cell.

See http://metadataconsulting.github.io/spreadsheet-builder/#_styles[the data formats section of the documentation] for more information on topic.

[source,groovy]
----
builder.build {
    style('light-green') {                                                  // <1>
        foreground lightGreen                                               // <2>
    }

    style('dollar') {
        format '$ #.00'
    }

    style('header') {
        font {                                                              // <3>
            make bold
            size 72
        }
    }
    style('top-left') {
        align top left                                                      // <4>
    }

    sheet {
        row {
            style 'light-green'                                             // <5>
            cell {
                value 3.2
                style 'dollar'                                              // <6>
            }
        }
    }
}
----

<1> Declaring the style `light-green`
<2> Setting the foreground color of the cell (solid fill is applied automatically)
<3> Declaring bold font with size of 72 points
<4> Aligning cell content to top left corner
<5> Using the named style `light-green` for whole row
<6> Using the names style `dollar` for single row

=== 3. Order

.Order
****
Shipping department needs to print an order to each package. Export single order to spreadsheet so it can
be printed to A4 paper in portrait orientation. Use formulas whenever possible instead of computed
values so the order can be updated manually if needed (i.g. there are not enought items on stock). For _EMEA_
territory print the currency values with _€_ sign and make the outer border double and inner dashed. For the rest of the
world print _EUR_ instead and make the border thick and thin respectively.

****

Implement method `buildOrder` in `ExcelIntegration` class to make `_03_ExportOrderAsExcelSpec` passing.
See link:xlsx/test03-EMEA.xlsx[existing file for EMEA region] and link:xlsx/test03-NA.xlsx[the rest of the world] for reference.

==== Page Settings

Each sheet can declare the paper size and orientation:

[source,groovy]
----
sheet {
    page {
        paper a5                                                            <1>
        orientation landscape                                               <2>
    }
}
----

<1> Set the paper size to A5
<2> Set the orientation to landscape

==== Stylesheets

You can externalize the style definition to separate class so it can be swap easily.

[source,groovy]
----
enum SpanishStyles implements Stylesheet {                                  // <1>

    INSTANCE

    @Override void declareStyles(CanDefineStyle stylable) {
        stylable.with {                                                     // <2>
            style 'border-thick-top', {
                border top, {
                    style thick
                    color black
                }
            }
        }
    }

}
----

<1> To create a stylesheet, implement `Stylesheet` interface (you can create `enum` to make it singleton)
<2> You usually declare styles within the `with` block so you don't have to repeat `stylable.` calls

Then you can apply the styles on top level of the builder code:

[source,groovy]
----
builder.build {
    apply SpanishStyles.INSTANCE                                            <1>
}
----

<1> Apply particular stylesheet on current spreadsheet (this usually happens withing `if-else` block

==== Named Cells and Formulas

You can declare names for cells so you can later refer them in formulas more easily.

[source,groovy]
----
cell {
    value line.price
    name "price_01"                                                         <1>
}
cell {
    value line.quantity
    name "qty_01"
}
cell {
    formula "#{price_01 * #{qty_01}"                                        <2>
    name "total_01"
}
----

<1> Declare name of the cell which needs to be unique within the whole spreadsheet
<2> Use the declared name in the formula with `#{name}`

==== Solution

You can verify your solution with the reference one link:solutions/03.html[here].

=== 4. Sales Charts

.Sales Charts
****
Create two charts displaying cumulated sales by territory and by product line.
****

Implement method `fillData` in `ExcelIntegration` class to make `_04_FillDataSpec` passing.
See link:xlsx/test04.xlsx[existing file] for reference.

==== Beyond the Builder (Charts etc.)

Apache POI as current underlying implementation is not capable of working with charts in spreadsheet files thus
the only way how to generate file with chart is to use a template file which refers to data area which is filled with
data using the API. The key point is to keep the data area dynamic. For example charts' _Y-Axis Area_ and and _Label Area_ can
be pointed to named range which was created using the `OFFSET` function.

You create new dynamic named range using menu _Insert - Name - Define_. The formula will be similar to following one:

----
=OFFSET(Sheet1!$A$1,0,0,Sheet1!$D$1,2)
----
First parameter is the the very first cell (top left).

Second and third parameter are row and column offset and we can keep them zero all the time.

Third parameter is number of rows to expand the range - this is the number of items printed and it needs to be stored in the spreadsheet somewhere and referenced here in the formula.

Fourth parameter is the column width of the range, e.g. 2 for a range having just two columns.

CAUTION: Syntax of functions and name of the functions varies in different language mutations of MS Excel.
http://www.piuha.fi/excel-function-name-translation/[Excel function name translation page] may be handy to figure out
the proper name of the `OFFSET` function in your locale. In locales where comma (',') is used for decimal point you may
need to replaces commas in the formula with semicolons `;`.

Named range cannot be used for chart data for the pie chart but two dynamic named ranges can be used for _Y-Axis_ and _Labels_ areas.

Once you have your template spreadsheet file ready with graphs and dynamic ranges you can simply pass it to the `build` method:

[source,groovy]
----
builder.build(templateFile) {                                               <1>
    sheet('Data') {                                                         <2>
        row(2) {                                                            <3>
            cell 'Cars'
            cell 1234.56
        }
    }
}
----

<1> Existing template is passed into the build method
<2> Either existing sheet `Data` is matched or new one is created
<3> Existing cells are rewritten or new ones are created in if not present in the template file yet

==== Solution

You can verify your solution with the reference one link:solutions/04.html[here].


=== 5. Pixel Art

.Pixel Art
****

Draw following smiley inside 1 cm grid.

image::smiley.png[]
****

Implement method `drawSmiley` in `ExcelIntegration` class to make `_05_HappySpec` passing.
See link:xlsx/test05.xlsx[existing file] for reference.

==== Using the Definition References

You can obtain the reference to _definition objects_ as the first parameter of definition closure.
These objects can be used in situations when another closure would shadow the delegate scope of the closure
or when you want to refactor code and extract part of the builder calls into separate methods.

[source,groovy]
----
row { RowDefinition rd ->
    10.times {
        rd.cell it
    }
}
----

==== Solution

You can verify your solution with the reference one link:solutions/05.html[here].

== Reading Spreadsheets

Last 3 exercises will show you how you can read files using spreadsheet criteria.

=== 6. Data Migration

.Data Migration
****
As a developer you are asked to import legacy data into new system. You only have data available in the form
of spreadsheet (_Sales Report_). You don't have to take care about _Customers_ and _Products_ duplicities (these
would be handeled by underlying persistence store).
****

Implement method `loadOrders` in `ExcelIntegration` class to make `_06_ImportOrdersSpec` passing.
The input data is similar to link:xlsx/test01.xlsx[Sales Report] generated in exercise 1.

==== Criteria Basics

Spreadsheet criteria follow the very same nested structure as the builder. For example to find a cell with
the value `Order Number` you can write following piece of code:

[source,groovy]
----
SpreadsheetCriteria criteria = PoiSpreadsheetCriteria.FACTORY.forStream(inputStream)    // <1>
Cell orderNumberHeader = criteria.query {                                               // <2>
    sheet {
        row {
            cell {
                value 'Order Number'                                                    // <3>
}   }   }   }.cell                                                                      // <4>
Integer cellColumn = orderNumberHeader?.column                                          // <5>
----

<1> There is only one implementation at the moment which is based on Apache POI
<2> Create new criteria query
<3> Query for cell will value `Order Number` within any column, row or sheet
<4> Return just a single cell or `null` if not found
<5> Return the numeric index of the column (1-based)

There are some handy predicates such as `range` you can add to method calls such as `row`.
Row and column numbers always starts with `1` as this is the number you can see in the spreadsheet.

[source,groovy]
----
SpreadsheetCriteriaResult orderNumbers = criteria.query {
    sheet {
        row(range(2, 5)) {                                                              // <1>
            cell('B')                                                                   // <2>
}   }   }
----

<1> Return only rows from `2` to `5`
<2> Return only cells in the column `B`

==== Data Rows

If you have typical data dump spreadsheet with headers in one row and data in the rest of the rows
you can wrap existing `Row` object into `DataRow` which allows to retrieve cells using the subscript operator `[]`.


[source,groovy]
----
DataRow dataRow = DataRow.create(orderRow, headerRow)
Object customerName = dataRow['Customer Name'].value
----

==== Reading Cell Values

When you get the `value` property of the `Cell` the return type will correspond the current type of the
cell stored in the spreadsheet (e.g. `String` or `Number`). This is problematic especially with temporal data
as these are stored as numbers as well. To read the values in appropriate type you can use `read` method of the cell
which accepts single parameter which is the desired type.

[source,groovy]
----
Cell dateCell = dataRow['Order Date']
Date date = dateCell?.read(Date)
----

=== 7. Order Received

.Order Received
****
Your company is ordering goods from _ACME Corp._ regulary. Order summary spreadsheet is always sent by email when
the order is dispatched. You are asked to import the new product quantities into your internal system for each order.
****

Implement method `loadProducts` in `ExcelIntegration` class to make `_07_ImportProductsSpec` passing.
The input data is similar to link:xlsx/test03-EMEA.xlsx[Order] generated in exercise 3.

==== Navigating the Result

You can easily navigate next or previous sheets using `next` and `previous` properties of the sheet.

You can easily navigate next or previous rows using `above` and `bellow` properties of the row.

You can easily navigate the cells around selected cell using `above`, `aboveRight`, `right`, `bellowRight`, `bellow`,
`bellowLeft`, `left` and `aboveLeft` properties of the cell.

[source,groovy]
----
Cell qtyHeadline = criteria.query {
    sheet {
        row {
            cell {
                value 'Qty'
            }
        }
    }
}
Integer firstQty = qty.bellow.read(Integer)

=== 8. LADS Challenge

.LADS Challenge
****
LADS is a company which is accredited to manage all the time tables for public transport in your country. They are
obligated by law to make the data available to public. To keep the monopoly they publish the data as spreadsheets
containing service hours for each stop. You are asked to read all the departures from the Airport stop for bus line 200
on the working day.
